# Endpoints

Each solution or server has some endpoints to refer to query data or to send a form to the server.

Surrealytics is based on a HTTP based endpoint. 
In the future we will support GraphQL endpoints as well but that needs to be sorted out in the future rather than now.

We will provide here documentation for all the endpoints available in Surrealytics.
