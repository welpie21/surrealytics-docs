# Introduction

Surrealytics is a analytics solution for SurrealDB. Aiming for simplicity and powerful data querying and representation. 
With the ability to add SurrealDB endpoints to your solution that you can view them each separately and also the ability to query against different SurrealDB endpoints.

Having privacy in your own hands. Surrealytics will provide you a docker image where you can host it somewhere but we also will provide you a public GitHub repository that you can clone freely. 
Make changes. 

The reason why I began with this idea / project in mind is to have freedom in what to make. From using BigQuery I've seen the flaws sometimes. Very strict syntax which is kind of confusing. Why this makes unique
is to be able to use SurrealDB syntax to make the query. This very powerful syntax you can make everything.
